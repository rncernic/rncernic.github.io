I've been an enthusiast and practitioner of data science and machine learning for a while. I have a Physics major and a couple of specializations in Innovation and Knowledge Management. After 40+ years working in different industries I became a consultant and interim manager and decided to formally improve my data science skills by taking some on-line specializations.

To better retain and expand some important concepts I'm gonna write about them and publish here.

Enjoy!
